![](giphyy.gif)

---
## Project Outline

The goal of this assignment was to formulate a comprehensive plan for Rarita (a fictional country) to construct an internationally competitive football team. Criteria for a "competitive" team was defined within the [SOA Student Case Study 2022](https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/static-pages/research/opportunities/2022-student-research-case-study.pdf) as:
>1. Rank within the top 10 members of the FSA for the season within the next 5 years.
>2. Have a high probability of achieving an FSA championship within the next 10 years.

The potential economic impacts of the team were also assessed, and given the uncertainty involved in such a venture, a thorough risk analysis was conducted, highlighting the key risks, impacts, and potential risk mitigation measures.

## Implementation Plan

### Revenues & Expenses
**Matchday**

We hope to make revenue from selling memberships and season ticket passes to supporters. From the outset, the aim is to sell memberships cheaper to appeal to the masses (Central/West Rarita). As the team becomes more competitive and more popular, the memberships should increase and as such we can adequately monitor and optimise the price to maximise revenue using economic modelling. The figures below were determined by assessing the average growth in match day revenue and correlating to positions finished in the respective national tournaments.
 - Current revenue is 24.63 Doubloons per capita
 - An expected increase of 4% per capita each year
 - Upon the completion of stadium building, we expect a one-year abnormal increase in match-day sales


**Sponsorships**

Finding sponsorships allows private investment into the team and provides the team with capital to spend on improving resources. The aim is to make early investments into hiring a sponsorship committee who will be devoted to creating sponsorship packages and then researching potential sponsors to partner with. As the club becomes more competitive and popular, we expect the sponsorship deals to increase in size and provide more revenue, goods and services for the club. The figures we have calculated reflect that sponsorship revenue was closely correlated to nations with high GDP.
 - Current revenue is 75.06 Doubloons per capita
 - We expect to receive close to 7% per capita increase in revenue each year
 - By Year 10, we expect to receive 150 Doubloons per capita from sponsorships and advertising


**Broadcasting**

The aim is to sell rights of broadcasting Rarita games to television companies on small-term contracts. Then, as the popularity and competitive nature of the team increases, we expect to sign longer-term contracts for higher deals. This is the biggest revenue stream we expect.
 - Current revenue is 63.44 Doubloons per capita
 - At Year 1, expected revenue of 72 Doubloons per capita
 - At Year 4, we expect to increase rights to 100 Doubloons per capita
 - At Year 6, we expect to be competing for FSA titles and securing a long-term deal at approximately 140 Doubloons per capita


**Social Media**

While our largest sources of revenue will be broadcasting rights and sponsorships, we expect social media to play a large role in popularizing Rarita’s team. This is evident in the correlation between a team’s past success and its social media following. Initiatives such as player interviews, behind the scene insights and matchday reviews led by a dedicated social media team will enhance fan following and encourage matchday attendance, whilst maintaining key sponsors. Additional revenue from a strong social media may be reinvested in supporting associated industries such as tourism and hospitality. 

**Staff Expenses**

Currently, staff expenses for competitive teams are larger in dollar terms (greater proportion of GDP), however we do not see correlation in terms of annual staff expense growth which is 6% across all nations.
 - Current expenses at 98.25 Doubloon per capita
 - Initial expenses to grow at 6% per capita each year
 - At Year 6, we expect an increase of growth rate to around 7.5% per capita

**Other Expenses** 

- We expect rent and facility management to grow by 10% each year
- With the stadium expected to be completed at the end of Year 3, we expect a one-off larger increase in expenses for that year

Estimated revenues and expenses on a yearly timeline are outlined below (all values expressed as Rarita Doubloons per capita)

| Year | Matchday | Sponsor | Broadcast | Staff | Other | UIUD Profit | **Expected Profit** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 25.00 | 78.00 | 72.00 | -98.25 | -50.44 | 26.31 | **27.23** |
| 2 | 26.00 | 83.46 | 79.20 | -104.15 | -55.48 | 29.03 | **31.03** |

| 9 | 35.89 | 137.81 | 154.34 | -165.65 | -108.12 | 54.27 | **70.31** |
| 10 | 37.69 | 148.84 | 169.78 | -178.07 | -118.93 | 59.29 | **78.94** |

### Key Monitoring Metrics

To measure the long-term financial sustainability of Rarita’s club, we monitor indicators on a yearly basis: 
 - Operating profit: gross margin of key commercial activities, borrowings ratio, staff costs as a percentage of total turnover
 - Team’s youth development KPIs: conversion rate to a professional contract, number of international caps won by home players whilst playing for club
 - Player trading performance: sell-on value of player registrations divided by the purchase value, indicating scouting talent ability


## Economic Impact

**GDP per Capita**
projected using Monte-Carlo simulations will have a $23.7bn growth by the end of 10 years, reaching $35,300 by 2030/

**GNI per Capita**
projected using Monte-Carlo simulations, will grow to $39,900 by 2030.



**Household Savings**
and Health Expenditure expected to remain flat through the next 10 years, impacts resulting from the implementation plan will be immaterial.

**Inflation**
is expected to increase in 2021 in the aftermath of the pandemic. Using an ARMA model, it gradually subsides to the long term average: 3%.

**Unemployment Rate** historically was estimated to be approx. 6.5% and projections are stable with unemployment gradually declining to 5%. 



**Related industries**
positively impacted include the sports betting, manufacturing, hospitality, tourism and transport industries.




## Risk Considerations
Forming a competative football team is a difficult undertaking and is subject to a broad range of risks. A risk analysis was completed to identify key risks faced by the team, the potential impact, and measures to mitigate the risk. 
#### Player Misconduct. 
Anti-social behaviour (both on and off-field) represented a considerable financial (quantitative) and reputation (qualitative) risk to Rarita. Experience from other sporting codes suggested the likelihood of severe misconduct by a player within the team is likely within the next 5 years. An incident could impact:
* Sponsor share prices. 
* Broadcasting revenue.
* Ticket sales. 
* Rarita's international tourism. 

Transfering or removing this risk was not possible. However, establishing a strict Player Code of Conduct (with enforceable penalties) to govern on and off-field behaviour was advised as a means to mitigate the risk. This would aid in reducing the frequency and severity of incidents. 

#### Poor Public Opinion
Though difficult to quantify, a lack of public support for Rarita’s national team and the investment would have considerable economic and political consequences for Rarita, and was identifed as another key risk. 
Potential impacts could be:
* Social and Politcal Unrest.
* Wasted public spending, and the foregone benefits of other investment such as in education or healthcare.
* Low broadcasting & ticket sale revenue. 

To mitigate this risk, it was advised to conduct focus groups, and liaise with key stakeholders in the community, to ensure the investment and national team’s introduction aligns with their broader interests.
